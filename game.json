Before hanging up, Mr.Pines mentioned that there had been some recent murmurs of lamps being stolen around town by a large individual with wild hair. People walking around the woods at night could hear shrieks from the sky and if they looked quickly enough they sometimes would catch a glance of giant ruby colored irises poking through the trees. Looking around the room you see that it is stocked with various items that could aid you on your quest. You grab only the essentials. You snatch a butterfly net, a flashlight, and a granola bar. The door is to the North. No time to waste! Mothman is bothering someone’s closet! Go and find him! ",
